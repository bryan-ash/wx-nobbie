= KNOWN ISSUES

On Windows there seems to be a strange delay between launching the application and it yielding control to the test
runner. It seems that the smaller the application, the worse the problem is (i.e. the longer it takes).

When typing into a TextCtrl, if the value being typed is the same as the current value it seems that on OSX the
text changed event is not fired, but on Windows it is.  I'm not sure which is correct, but the result should be
consistent - so this looks like a WxRuby issue.

When typing into a readonly ComboBox, on Windows the value changes which is not consistent with the WxRuby
documentation for 'set_value'. (might be fixed)

OSX seems to have some problems with regard to the UI repainting and the timing/order of events. Further
investigation is required but there are two problems highlighted in the tests. (1) when a value is set for a TextCtrl 
during initialisation it is not painted to the screen untill you focus on it.  (2) when typing into a ComboBox the
events value seems to be behind what is actually typed, e.g. if you type 'ab', two events are raised, but the values
are '' and 'a'.

Element highlighting seems to be a bit too quick in Windows.

Currently there is no way to interact with the UI if an operation results in a blocking dialog.  For example,
if 'File -> New' results in a FileDialog being displayed, test execution stops until the blocking dialog
has been closed manually.  This is annoying and I welcome suggestions of how to overcome this problem, in a platform
neutral way.
